# A-Spec
Mazda (Mazdaspeed) A-Spec Stickers from the 1990s

I'm an engineer and not a designer. So I have no idea about how to do this in Illustrator, so I did the whole thing in Photoshop. (So I got no AI file for you, sorry. Please don't hate me)

I'm sharing this for free. Please use / share / edit / print / cut as you like. (there are sellers in AliExpress / eBay who will print / cut these for around $6 for 2 pieces)

I've uploaded the files in white / black / silver / red, so you can check and download them if you like.
